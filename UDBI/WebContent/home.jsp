			Database Interface is an industry-standard 
			tool for application development. 
			Using Database Interface, developers can 
			interact with any back end software 
			(i.e. Oracle, MS-SQL Server, MS-Access, 
			My-SQL etc).  The database interface can 
			be used to build, test, and debug PL/SQL 
			packages, procedures, triggers, and 
			functions. Database Interface users can 
			create and edit database objects such as tables, views, indexes, constraints, and users.  Database Interface's SQL Editor provides an easy and efficient way to write and test scripts and queries, and its powerful data grids provide an easy way to view and edit data related to any DBMS/RDBMS tool.

The innovative idea behind this project is to build a 
Generic Database Interface. Any user who has expertise 
in any Database can login through this Interface to 
connect to his acquainted Database can do all database 
operations.
